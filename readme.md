##Work Area for practicing PCA

This is my repo for practicing, learning and demonstrating concepts with Dimensionality reduction techniques with PCA(Principal Component Analysis). I will likely use some of this content to create blog posts (if I come up with something interesting) to share what I've learnt. I also intend to try things out in multiple languages starting with Python and R.
